title: About me
---


Hi, I’m Zarrina, a data science enthusiast, and I’ve started my journey into data science not so long ago. Growing up, I loved math and social sciences, so I studied economics. At my first job, I worked on a project of BI implementation and creating databases, and so I discovered I liked coding. Then, I studied in a coding school and learned web development, mostly using JavaScript. While in coding school, I’ve built a couple of projects using Machine Learning API’s and that’s how I’ve discovered data science and machine learning, and I was fascinated by what can be achieved using Machine Learning. Now, studying data science, I use skills I’ve learned before - math, statistics, and coding. I believe, my knowledge of economics and business also help me to understand and solve business problems in an efficient way too. I’m very excited about my data science journey and looking forward to seeing what it brings!
